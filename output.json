        "postContent": "Presenting DeepSeek simple with a bit of technical depth.\n\nFinally, I finished my post on DeepSeek, the Chinese LLM that drove the AI community by storm.\n\nHere is the post link published on my blog on GitHub:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/d-WwwzpM\n\n\nI tried to cover various perspectives:\nWhat is so particular about \nhashtag\n#deepseek compared to other models?\nHow RL plays its role making it a landmark step in AI progress?\nWhat is MoE (Mixture of Experts) architecture?\nWhat is the standard pipeline of developing and LLM and what is the key change that DeepSeek introduced?\nWhat are those versions of DeepSeek: R1, R1-Zero, and V3? What is the story behind them?\nWhat are the innovations (mostly introduced in the V3 model) other than the RL introduced by this model?\n\nI hope you will enjoy reading it. It is a bit technical. So having a bit of experience in the field of LLMs will make reading it more fun.\n\nI want to end this post by giving special credit to other great works that really helped me during the writing of this article. To mention some:\nJay Alammar post: The illustrated deepseek.\nMaarten Grootendorst YouTube videos on the MoE architecture.\nThis great podcast: https://lnkd.in/d7TPvngn by Mohamed Rashad and Youssef Hosni \nThis great series of articles: https://lnkd.in/dzuUG8fR\nThis post on MoE by Hugging Face team: https://lnkd.in/dVKgkKxm.",

        "postContent": "DeepSeek Debates: Chinese Leadership On Cost, True Training Cost, Closed Model Margin Impacts H100 Pricing Soaring, Subsidized Inference Pricing, Export Controls, MLA\n\nIn a February 2, 2025 article for SemiAnalysis, authors Dylan Patel, AJ Kourabi, Doug O'Laughlin, and Reyk Knuhtsen provide an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company that has recently captured global attention.\n\nThe authors detail how DeepSeek, which spun off from the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer in May 2023, has emerged as a significant player in the AI landscape. With approximately 150 employees and substantial computing resources including 50,000 Hopper GPUs, the company has made remarkable technical strides. Their infrastructure represents a significant investment, with server capital expenditure estimated at $1.6 billion and operating costs of $944 million.\n\nAccording to the analysis, DeepSeek's recent prominence stems from several technical innovations, particularly their Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture, which reduces memory requirements by 93.3%. The company has also successfully implemented an efficient Mixture of Experts model architecture and utilized Multi-Token Prediction at unprecedented scales.\n\nThe authors challenge the widely circulated claim that DeepSeek V3 cost only $6 million to train, explaining that this figure represents merely the GPU costs for pre-training and excludes crucial expenses such as R&D, infrastructure, and operational costs. They position DeepSeek's achievements within a broader industry trend where algorithmic improvements enable similar capabilities with decreasing compute requirements.\n\nIn comparing DeepSeek's performance to competitors, the authors note that while DeepSeek R1 matches OpenAI's o1 in reasoning capabilities, it doesn't consistently lead across all metrics. They also highlight that Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 Thinking achieves comparable or superior results at lower costs, though it has received less attention.\n\nThe article concludes by examining potential industry implications, suggesting that DeepSeek may be subsidizing inference costs to gain market share. The authors also raise concerns about DeepSeek's use of training data from OpenAI's models, suggesting this could lead to future policy changes regarding model distillation.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides important context for understanding DeepSeek's rapid rise in the AI landscape and its potential impact on the industry's future development.\n\nLink: https://loom.ly/PXUme8c.

        "postContent": "La scorsa settimana, da un post Instagram dell’ottimo Matteo Flora sulla censura operata dall’AI Deepseek, è nato un bellissimo scambio di esperienze. Qualcuno tra i commentatori, tanti per la verità, faceva notare quanto, diversamente dall’AI cinese, \"l’occidentale\" ChatGPT fosse equilibrata nelle risposte. Certo, meglio risposte ampie e argomentate che la censura, direbbe il “filosofo” Max Catalano. Avevo alcuni dubbi allora, però, e ne ho di più oggi. \n\nLa domanda cruciale è sempre la stessa introdotta da Matteo: quanto sono affidabili le opinioni generate dall’AI su temi politici e sociali? Oggi, la domanda non è più teorica: e un nuovo studio pubblicato su Science Direct ci aiuta in una prima risposta, fornendoci i dati concreti sull’influenza politica dei chatbot.\n\nE cosa ti scoprono, i ricercatori di University of East Anglia, Getulio Vargas Foundation e Insper? Che non c'è solo la censura esplicita dell'AI cinese: anche ChatGPT orienta il dibattito politico. Attraverso un'analisi sistematica di risposte testuali e immagini generate, il team ha svelato processi radicati che potrebbero plasmare l'opinione pubblica. \n\nNon è un caso isolato, e non è una questione di “Oriente contro Occidente” o di sistemi più o meno censori: ogni approccio alla moderazione dei contenuti AI porta con sé i suoi rischi e i suoi pregiudizi. È bene che lo sappiate, per non cadere facili prede di qualche IA \"buona\", percepita in modo diverso da altre IA \"cattivone\".\n\n\nhashtag\n#Intelligenza \nhashtag\n#Manipolazione \nhashtag\n#Democrazia \nhashtag\n#Dibattito \nhashtag\n#Tecnologia",

DeepSeek proves that smaller, well-trained models can compete with the big ones – but they still require significant expertise, data, and resources.\n🔹 Customization beats building from scratch. Leveraging and fine-tuning existing AI solutions is faster, more cost-efficient, and delivers immediate business value.\n🔹 Industry expertise matters. AI isn’t just about engineering – without deep domain knowledge and real-world data, it won’t drive meaningful impact.\n🔹 AI is never \"done.\" Continuous training, updates, and monitoring are essential – AI is a long-term investment, not a one-time project.\n\n👉 Instead of reinventing the wheel, companies should adopt and refine proven AI solutions – it’s the fastest way to real impact.\n\nDaniel Stepa Sjoerd IJedema Max Ortega Beth R.

But how do they really compare? Here’s my take after using both:\n\n💬 User Experience\n\nChatGPT feels smooth, engaging, and natural in conversations. It’s great for brainstorming, writing, and general Q&A.\nDeepSeek is more structured and precise, especially when it comes to logic and reasoning. But sometimes, it feels a bit rigid compared to ChatGPT.\n\n📚 Language & Understanding\n\nChatGPT excels in English and other languages, making it super versatile.\nDeepSeek is optimized for Chinese but is improving in multilingual support.\n\n🔢 Math & Logical Reasoning\n\nChatGPT does well in general problem-solving but sometimes struggles with complex math.\nDeepSeek prioritizes logical accuracy and mathematical reasoning, making it stronger in technical queries.\n\n🎨 Creativity vs. Precision\n\nIf you need creativity—like storytelling, idea generation, or content writing—ChatGPT wins.\nIf you need structured, factual, and precise answers, DeepSeek might be a better bet.\nBoth are impressive in their own ways, but it really comes down to what you need. Have you tried both? Which one feels more \"intelligent\" to you?

As cliché as it sounds, our network really is our net worth. Let’s build it before we need and give before we take. \n\n✅ 2 // Leverage LinkedIn. Our profile should be a 24/7 job lead machine. Optimize it with the right verbiage and keywords to be found. \n\n✅ 3 // Tap the “hidden job market.” Most remote jobs are filled through referrals. Tapping the hidden market allows us to discover these roles before they hit the boards. \n\nThe traditional job search is dead. Give it a little love and refresh, and we’ll be just fine. \n\nQuestion - What’s your #1 job search tip for a new job seeker? How’s the market changing? \n\nHere’s to us “escaping the cubicle” Wes\n\n\nhashtag\n#remotework \nhashtag\n#jobsearchtips",

        "postContent": "🚀 India’s Hiring Trends in 2025: India’s job market is witnessing major shifts in 2025. Some industries are expanding aggressively, while others are struggling with hiring slowdowns.\n\nSectors Experiencing a Hiring Boom:\n🖥️ Information Technology (IT)\n🔹 The IT sector is leading hiring with a 50% net employment outlook, driven by AI, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and data analytics. Companies are focusing on automation and digital transformation, creating strong demand for highly skilled professionals.\n\nBanking, Financial Services & Insurance (BFSI)\n🔹 The BFSI sector continues to expand, with 7.2% job growth. Fintech companies are driving demand for roles in digital banking, risk management, and compliance. The insurance sector is also hiring aggressively as more people seek financial security.\n\n⚡ Renewable Energy\n🔹 India’s green energy push is generating jobs in solar, wind, and sustainability consulting. The shift towards clean energy and net-zero targets is creating opportunities in engineering, project management, and policy roles.\n\n📉 Sectors Facing Hiring Challenges: \n\n🏭 Manufacturing\n🔹 Despite ‘Make in India,’ manufacturing job growth remains sluggish. The sector’s GDP contribution is stagnant at 14.7%, and hiring is slow due to high production costs, policy bottlenecks, and weak consumer demand. Some sub-sectors like electronics and automobiles are expanding, but overall growth is limited.\n\n🛒 Retail\n🔹 The rise of e-commerce is affecting brick-and-mortar stores, leading to fewer hiring opportunities in traditional retail. However, there’s still demand in logistics, supply chain management, and customer experience roles in online commerce.\n\n📶 Telecom\n🔹 While 5G expansion is underway, hiring remains focused on specialized technical roles rather than mass recruitment. Automation and AI-powered customer service are reducing workforce expansion, keeping hiring numbers low.\n\n\nhashtag\n#HiringTrends\n \nhashtag\n#IndiaJobs \n\nhashtag\n#CareerGrowth \n\nhashtag\n#JobMarket2025 \n\nhashtag\n#FutureOfWork\n\nhashtag\n#Guidinglightmentors",

Your skills. \n\nThe people who stay ahead are the ones who: \n\n✅ Keep learning new things \n✅ Stay adaptable and open to change \n✅ Take control of their own growth \n\nYour company isn’t your safety net. \nYour boss isn’t your safety net. \nYOU are your safety net. \n\nThe moment you stop investing in yourself, \nyou start falling behind. \n\nSo here’s your reminder: \n\n📌 Upskill. \n📌 Stay curious. \n📌 Build something of your own. \n\nBecause when you bet on yourself, no recession, no layoff, and no company decision can shake you. \n\nHave a great week ahead! 🚀",

Whether you’re actively job searching or just keeping an eye out for opportunities, here are some key things I’ve learned:\n\n🔹 Skills Matter, But So Do Stories – Companies don’t just look for technical skills; they value how you solve problems, collaborate, and adapt. Being able to communicate your impact is just as important as your coding abilities.\n\n🔹 Networking Opens Doors – A single conversation can lead to unexpected opportunities. Engaging with the tech community, attending meetups, and staying active on LinkedIn can make a big difference.\n\n🔹 Tech Stacks Evolve—So Should We – Staying updated with emerging technologies (AI, cloud, DevOps, etc.) helps keep us relevant in a competitive market. Continuous learning is key!\n\n🔹 Job Searching is a Marathon, Not a Sprint – Rejections are tough, but each one is a step toward the right opportunity. Persistence and a growth mindset make all the difference.\n\nI’d love to hear from others—what’s been your biggest learning from job searching in the tech industry?

While some industries are experiencing a hiring slowdown, others are competing for top talent in an increasingly selective market.\n\n✅ For Employers: Finding the right candidate is tougher than ever. Candidates have more options, expectations are shifting, and a slow hiring process can mean losing top talent to competitors. If your team is struggling to fill roles, it’s time to rethink your hiring strategy because the best candidates aren’t waiting around.\n\n✅ For Job Seekers: Despite economic uncertainty, opportunities are out there. But securing the right job requires more than just submitting applications. A strong resume, the right connections, and a strategic approach can make all the difference.\n\nAt Williams Recruiting Services, we bridge the gap between great companies and top-tier talent. As a contingent recruiter, I only get paid when I successfully place a candidate meaning my focus is on results, not just resumes.\n\nIf you’re an employer looking to streamline your hiring process or a professional ready to land your next role, let’s connect. \n\nVisit www.williamsrs.com or send me a message to discuss how I can help 904-800-8390\n\n\nhashtag\n#WilliamsRecruitingServices \nhashtag\n#Hiring \nhashtag\n#JobMarket2025 \nhashtag\n#Recruiting \nhashtag\n#JobSearch \nhashtag\n#TalentAcquisition",

It’s a thing of the past.\n\nIn 2025, major companies like Meta, Infosys, Apple, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Tesla are laying off employees. Even the biggest names in the industry are hiring in bulk—only to fire in bulk later. \n\nBig Tech Companies—Not as Stable as They Seem\nLarge corporations expand one quarter and downsize the next.\nSome are even delaying fresher onboarding by one or two years!\nLayoffs are becoming the norm, and job security is no longer guaranteed.\n\nStartups—More Learning, More Uncertainty\nStartups don’t offer stability, but they provide hands-on experience.\nYou’ll take on diverse roles, gain business insights, and develop faster.\nThe catch? Success depends on whether the startup survives.\n\nWhat Should Students Do in 2025?\n✅ Don’t rely solely on campus placements.\n A degree no longer guarantees a job. The system is changing.\n✅ Start gaining experience early.\n Internships, freelancing, and open-source projects can give you an edge before graduation.\n✅ Focus on skills, not just resumes.\n With AI and automation reshaping industries, companies value problem solvers over textbook knowledge.\n✅ Stay adaptable.\n The 9-to-5 security bubble has burst. Instead of chasing big names, look for opportunities that foster long-term growth.\n\nJob security is an illusion. Big tech is downsizing, and startups are unpredictable.\n\nThe best investment? Yourself. The more adaptable and skilled you are, the less market fluctuations will impact you.\n💡 What’s your take? Is startup experience better than waiting for a big tech job?\n\n\nhashtag\n#hr \nhashtag\n#freshers2025 \nhashtag\n#mncjobs \nhashtag\n#jobs2025 \nhashtag\n#recruitment \nhashtag\n#freshers \nhashtag\n#hiring",
